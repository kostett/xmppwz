xmppwz
======

XMPP-bot which sends METAR weather data by city code

Installing:
- JID setup: register it, add ICQ/MRIM/AOL/etc transport (if necessary), fill info and logout
- install xmpppy (in Arch Linux) or python-xmpp (in Debian)
- put xmppwz.conf to /etc/xmppwz.conf and fill in JID and password
- put xmppwz.py wherever you want and do it executable (chmod +x xmppwz.py)
- run xmppwz.py

How to make it daemonize? Google knows.
